# MMNet
MMNet is a massive MIMO signal detection scheme based on light online learning with neural networks that extends to correlated channel scenarios. 

## Introduction
I forked this repository from mehrdadkhani/MMNet.

I provide the supplement to the missing part "normalization" of the code.

The code of "normalizaion" is put in the "channel" directory and the related details is written in README in that directory.
